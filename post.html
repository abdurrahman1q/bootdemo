            <h3>Synopsis:</h3>
            With the rising tide of steam power and machinery, who can come close to being a Beyonder? Shrouded in the
            fog of history and darkness, who or what is the lurking evil that murmurs into our ears? Waking up to be
            faced with a string of mysteries, Zhou Mingrui finds himself reincarnated as Klein Moretti in an alternate
            Victorian era world where he sees a world filled with machinery, cannons, dreadnoughts, airships, difference
            machines, as well as Potions, Divination, Hexes, Tarot Cards, Sealed Artifacts…

            The Light continues to shine but the mystery has never gone far. Follow Klein as he finds himself entangled
            with the Churches of the world—both orthodox and unorthodox—while he slowly develops newfound powers thanks
            to the Beyonder potions. Like the corresponding tarot card, The Fool, which is numbered 0—a number of
            unlimited potentials—this is the legend of “The Fool.”<br>

            <h3>Surface Review</h3>
            Lord of the Mysteries novel is one of the amazing novels I have ever read. It’s my NUMBER ONE. It is
            different from typical Chinese novels filled with Cultivation, and systems.
            The world is vastly complex and dangerous. A wrong step leads to severe consequences. The characters are
            twisted, perplexing, mysterious, lovable, greedy, loathsome, cunning, etc with their own deep schemes. Be
            careful of your newborn baby. You never know he will destroy the city.

            It is one of the most unique and bizarre novels. I started reading Lord of the Mysteries because of the
            multiple great reviews and I was not disappointed. Every time I finished reading a chapter, I was left
            wanting more. Two chapters daily were no way enough for me.

            We follow Klein Moretti as he explores the world filled with machinery, cannons, dreadnoughts, airships, and
            different steampunk machines. This story is his adventure to uncover mysteries one by one and how he gets
            stronger while gathering various people from different places and forms an organization together with them
            even to influence the world.



            <h3>World</h3>
            You can say that the world setting is one of its strengths. The setting of the world is the Victorian era
            and it is done very masterfully. You can tell the author has done his research very well. The world that we
            see is similar to the modern world – there exist normal jobs, education gets encouraged, universities,
            police, inventions, churches, etc. Only with horse-drawn carriages, maidservants, top hats, and canes…

            World history is immensely complicated. The story focuses on history as it plays an important part. DO NOT
            SKIP the history as one by one the author Cuttlefish That Loves Diving brings them back to life.

            Besides history, the author also focuses on economics. To obtain power in this world, you have to have
            enough money to purchase the potion materials. Every character here focuses on earning the money in one way
            or another.

            <h3>Power System</h3>
            Lord of the Mysteries has the best Power System. The author has done yet again a great work in Power System.
            This steampunk set world has Beyonder who obtain powers using potions. They use Potions to obtain power from
            different pathways and to level up their sequences. Potions are made from ingredients i.e. from magical
            creatures, which are a very small part of the story. There are 22 pathways. Every single one has its own
            unique traits and depending on the situation, and any one of them could be powerful depending on the use.
            The way how the names of the potion are thought and their power are designed is simply brilliant.
            Knowledge is power and as long as you have enough knowledge of your opponent’s pathway you can almost always
            make a victory plan as long as the difference in the sequence isn’t too big. Some pathways have a
            requirement for intelligence, like the lawyer, seer, and apprentice and some are pure instincts like the
            Luck and Devil pathway.

            <h3>Characters</h3>
            The characters have their own personalities and are not there just to cheer the main character on, like in
            many other novels. The characters have their own personality, beliefs, and work hard to get powerful and
            survive in that dangerous world.

            The main character i.e Klein is not overpowered from the beginning but he does have a special power that
            helps him stay ahead of others but not by very much. The enemies that he faces are realistic for a fantasy
            world. The enemies are cunning and way ahead in terms of power. Klein uses his brain and tricks to win
            against them.

            <h3>In Conclusion</h3>
            Lord of the Mysteries novel is a very high-quality novel, pretty much anything it does is extremely well
            written. The only thing that might be lacking is some romance, but at the same time, it doesn’t quite fit
            this novel so it’s not exactly a bad thing either.

            <p class="fst-italic fw-light">Note: I have not mentioned many things such as Gods, spirits, Artifacts,
                rituals, etc.
                I hope you can go
                read the story and explore as well as discover the amazing yet bizarre world of Lord of Mysteries.</p>
            <h4>You should expect:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>High-Quality Main and Side-characters</li>
                <li>Great character development</li>
                <li>Fantastic World Building</li>
                <li>Detailed fight scenes</li>
                <li>Schemes and Plots of the highest level</li>
                <li>Amazing twist and turns</li>
                <li> Intriguing mysteries all over the place
                    And so much more.</li>
            </ul>

            <p class="fw-lighter  fst-italic">One thing that is lacking is the pace at the start but trust me once you
                read volume one, you can’t stop.
